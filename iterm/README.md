# iTerm

## Font

I am using _Iosevka Term Slab Nerd Font_ in the terminal at a 140 line height in iTerm2:
https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Iosevka

Before that, I used _JetBrains Mono Nerd Font_ at a 120 line height:

Select a new font by going to:

`Settings` → `Profiles` → `Text` → `Font`

## Color scheme

I am using the _Gruvbox_ theme for iTerm included in this directory.

Import and select it by going to:

`Settings` → `Profiles` → `Colors` → `Color Presets` → `Import`
